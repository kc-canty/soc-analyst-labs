## Objective

Perform a targeted vulnerability scan against a Windows host using Nessus Essentials, identify high-risk exposures, and prioritize them the way an entry-level Threat Hunter or SOC analyst would at CrowdStrike.

This lab demonstrates:
- Vulnerability identification and triage  
- Understanding attacker behavior and exploitability  
- Mapping vulnerabilities to real-world threat activity  
- Producing clear, concise security documentation  
- Building foundational skills for endpoint detection & response (EDR) workflows

## Tools Used

- **Nessus Essentials** – vulnerability scanning  
- **Windows 10/11 host system**  
- **CVSS Score Calculator** – severity interpretation  
- **MITRE ATT&CK framework** – threat mapping
