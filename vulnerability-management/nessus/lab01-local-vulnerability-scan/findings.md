# Findings — Lab 01: Local Vulnerability Assessment

**Scan Tool:** Nessus Essentials  
**Target Host:** 127.0.0.1 (localhost)  
**Scan Type:** Basic Network Scan  
**Date Performed:** *(Add date)*  
**Analyst:** Keith C. Canty

## Summary of Findings

The vulnerability scan returned:

- **Critical:** 0  
- **High:** 0  
- **Medium:** 0  
- **Low:** 0  
- **Info:** 2  

These results are expected when scanning a fully patched host using a **non-credentialed scan** against `127.0.0.1`, where the scanner has limited access and no exposed services to probe.

Even so, these findings are valid for documenting Nessus functionality and demonstrating a complete vulnerability assessment workflow.

## Why Only Informational Findings Appeared

Informational results occur when no exploitable vulnerabilities are present and the scanner cannot enumerate deeper system attributes.

This happens because:

- Loopback (`127.0.0.1`) restricts full network probing  
- No credentials were provided (no registry/service/software inspection)  
- The host is fully patched  
- There are no open network services to evaluate  

This is normal and acceptable for **Lab 01**.

# Detailed Findings

Below is a breakdown of the two Info-level findings from the scan.

---

## 1️ **Nessus Scan Information**

**Severity:** Info  
**Description:**  
This finding provides general information about the Nessus scan itself. It commonly lists metadata such as:

- Scan start/end time  
- Policies applied  
- Host response information  
- System identifiers detected during initial handshake  

This is a **baseline discovery check**, confirming communication between Nessus and the target host.

**Risk:**  
No security risk. Informational only.

**Why It Appears:**  
Every Nessus scan includes this plugin to document what was detected during the initial enumeration phase.

**Recommendation:**  
None required. Included for audit trail and transparency.

## 2️ **Ping the Remote Host**

**Severity:** Info  
**Description:**  
This finding simply indicates that the host **responded to ICMP Echo Requests** (ping). It confirms the host is reachable.

**Risk:**  
No direct risk.  
Some organizations disable ICMP to reduce recon surface, but it is not inherently dangerous.

**Why It Appears:**  
Nessus checks host responsiveness as part of the scan pre-flight process.  
If the host responds, Nessus proceeds with more probes.

**Recommendation:**  
Optional: Organizations with strict network hardening may block ICMP responses, but most internal networks allow ping for operational reasons.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping (Informational Only)

While these findings do not reflect a vulnerability, they relate conceptually to early attacker reconnaissance techniques:

- **T1018 — Remote System Discovery**  
- **T1046 — Network Service Scanning**  
- **T1595 — Active Scanning (Recon)**  

This highlights how security tools and adversaries may perform similar reconnaissance behaviors.

---

## Environment Context (System Enumeration)

The following context files were captured:

- `system-info.txt` — Host OS, hardware, architecture  
- `installed-programs.txt` — Installed software


- `system-info.txt` — Host OS, hardware, architecture  
- `installed-programs.txt` — Installed software packages  

These files help validate:

- Patch posture  
- Installed software versions  
- Host configuration integrity  

No outdated or vulnerable applications were observed.

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Perform a Credentialed Scan (Lab 03)  
Enabling Windows credentials will allow Nessus to identify:

- Missing patches  
- Vulnerable software versions  
- Privilege escalation weaknesses  
- Misconfigurations  
- Registry and service-level vulnerabilities  

### 2. Perform a Host Discovery Scan (Lab 02)  
Useful for validating network visibility and understanding what assets respond to scanning.

### 3. Scan a secondary host or intentionally vulnerable system  
This produces richer findings for comparison and demonstration.

## Conclusion

This lab demonstrates:

- Proper Nessus scan setup  
- Accurate interpretation of Info-level results  
- Understanding of scanner limitations  
- Professional documentation of vulnerability assessments  
- Foundational skills for SOC, vulnerability management, and IR roles  

Although no exploitable vulnerabilities were identified, the workflow reflects real-world enterprise scanning and sets the stage for deeper analysis in upcoming labs.
