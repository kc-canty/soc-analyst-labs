# Lab 01 — Local Vulnerability Assessment (Nessus Essentials)

**Role Alignment:** SOC Analyst (Entry-Level), Vulnerability Analyst, Threat Hunter  
**Estimated Time:** 45–60 minutes  
**Author:** *Keith C. Canty*

---

## Objective

Conduct a vulnerability assessment against a local Windows host using Nessus Essentials, interpret the results, and document the workflow using screenshots and video evidence.  

Although this scan resulted in **two Info-level findings**, this demonstrates a correct and complete scanning workflow — essential for SOC and vulnerability management roles.

This lab demonstrates:

- Vulnerability scanning workflow  
- Host context collection  
- Report generation  
- Interpreting low-severity results  
- Documenting security assessments professionally  

---

## Tools Used

- **Nessus Essentials** – Vulnerability scanning  
- **Windows 10/11 host system**  
- **PowerShell** – System enumeration  
- **CVSS Calculator**  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**  

---

## Evidence Collected

All screenshots, recordings, and reports are stored in:
evidence/
reports/
system/

## Screenshot Evidence

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `new-scan-config.png` | Basic Network Scan configuration |
| `scan-summary.png` | Completed scan overview with severity count |
| `top-info-findings.png` | List of Info-level findings discovered |

---

## Video Evidence

Some Nessus results require scrolling; thus, video evidence provides a complete record.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `scan-summary.mp4` | Full scroll-through of completed scan results |
| `vuln-details.mp4` | Plugin detail review of Info-level findings |
| `scan-config-walkthrough.mp4` | Recording of Nessus configuration navigation |

> Videos are stored in `.mp4` format for maximum compatibility.

## Reports

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `nessus-lab01-report.pdf` | Nessus PDF export |
| `nessus-lab01-report.html` | HTML export for easier navigation |

---

## System Enumeration Evidence

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `system-info.txt` | Host environment information (`systeminfo`) |
| `installed-programs.txt` | Installed software inventory (`wmic product get name,version`) |

## Procedure Overview

### 1 Environment Setup  
- Verified Nessus installation  
- Gathered system context  
- Created repo structure (`evidence`, `reports`, `system`)

### 2️ Scan Configuration  
- Type: **Basic Network Scan**  
- Target: `127.0.0.1`  
- Default settings retained  

### 3️ Scan Execution  
- Ran scan; runtime ~5–20 minutes  
- Exported reports (PDF, HTML)

### 4️ Findings Overview  
Scan results:

- **Critical:** 0  
- **High:** 0  
- **Medium:** 0  
- **Low:** 0  
- **Info:** 2  

This is normal for a fully patched system with no credentialed access.

### 5️ Analysis Summary

Even with only Info findings, the scan:

- Validates scanner functionality  
- Confirms low host exposure  
- Provides a baseline assessment  
- Documents low-risk informational checks  
- Prepares the environment for deeper scans (Labs 02 & 03)
