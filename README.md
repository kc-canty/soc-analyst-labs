## Current & Actively Maintained Portfolio

All of my **latest and actively maintained cybersecurity projects, labs, and documentation** can be found here:

 **https://github.com/kc-canty/cybersecurity-portfolio**

This portfolio represents:
- My most up-to-date hands-on labs  
- Ongoing cybersecurity learning and experimentation  
- Projects aligned with security operations, analysis, and foundational cloud/security concepts

## Why the Change?

As my cybersecurity journey has progressed, I consolidated my work into a single, well-organized portfolio to make it easier for reviewers, recruiters, and hiring managers to see my most relevant and current projects in one place.

Thank you again for your interest, and please refer to the linked portfolio for the most accurate representation of my work.
