# SOC Analyst Labs Portfolio  
### Hands-On Cybersecurity Projects by ***Keith C. Canty***

Welcome to my SOC Analyst Labs Portfolio — a collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects created to develop and demonstrate the foundational skills required for SOC Analyst, Cybersecurity Analyst, and Threat Monitoring roles.

This portfolio represents my transition into cybersecurity, combining labs, self-study, certification prep (Security+, SC-200, CCNA), and structured documentation to mirror real-world analyst workflows.
