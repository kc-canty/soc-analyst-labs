# Linux Security Labs

This repository showcases my hands-on journey with Linux from a security perspective.

Each lab focuses on:
- Core Linux commands and system administration
- Security basics: accounts, permissions, logs, services, and network exposure
- Incident-style documentation: what I did, what I observed, and why it matters
